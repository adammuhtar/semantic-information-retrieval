# Semantic Information Retrieval
Semantic information retrieval is a groundbreaking approach to information search and retrieval that leverages machine learning techniques to efficiently and accurately identify relevant content. By transcending traditional keyword or rules-based methods, semantic retrieval focuses on understanding the underlying meaning and context of queries and documents, enabling more intelligent and comprehensive search results. Harnessing the power of natural language processing, deep learning architectures, and vector space representations, this advanced form of information retrieval empowers users to find information that is contextually relevant and matches their intent, significantly enhancing the overall search experience.

This repository contains Jupyter/Colab notebooks that runs semantic search models on consumer-grade hardware, utilising off-the-shelf models from [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net)

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine or open the notebooks directly in Google Colab (click on the "Open in Colab" icons at the start of the notebooks). The notebooks contain detailed instructions on how to use the models and how to modify the code to suit your specific needs.
